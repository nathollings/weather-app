# Old Weather 



Using IntertiaJS with LaravelBreeze



## Basically

What I read is I needed a way for Professionals boaties to figure out a plan bassed on the weather 8 years ago.

I grab the data via Http rather than downloading the file. because in the real world I would be grabbing new data... I should have cached it. 

Next I used Laravel Breeze with IntertiaJS to build the "SPA" frontend. so no api was used... 

Now I have no idea what information is important... and its probably different for every boat guy/gal. So they can choose their own data. and see what suits. 




## packages 
#### php

 - Laravel Breeze

 - GuzzleHTTP PHP

 - Carbon.. kind of.. it comes with Laravel.

#### vue

 - Laravel Breeze
 - IntertiaJS -> wish I had played with this sooner.
 - MomentJS
 - ChartJS 
 - Random svgs off the net.
